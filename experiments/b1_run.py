"""B1: guided-operator ablation for the thesis (advisor-directed reframing).

Holds the selection policy fixed (uniform random) and varies only the operator
pool: generic (7 paper neighborhoods) / critical (+g1,g2) / full (+g3,g4 ==
ACTIONS_TW). This isolates the contribution of the bottleneck- and
tardiness-guided operators, which the selector ablation (uniform/tabular/DQN)
cannot show. It directly supports the claim that performance comes from the
guided search structure, not from a learned selection policy.

Test-pool measurement, same cells as K1. The three arms are structurally
pre-specified (no tuning), so this is analysis, not hyperparameter selection;
the `full` arm reproduces GILS-uniform-1000 exactly (a consistency check).

Usage:
    python experiments/b1_run.py            # run the ablation grid
