"""B2: engine-component ablation (leave-one-out) for the thesis.

Holds the selection policy fixed (uniform) and the operator pool fixed (full),
and removes one engine component at a time to measure its marginal contribution
to the near-optimal attractor:

    none    -> final greedy engine (reference, == v2-GILS-uniform-1000);
    init    -> VAA construction replaced by a random feasible start;
    descent -> best-improvement descent removed;
    restart -> kick-restart on stagnation removed;
    addsa   -> SA acceptance with reheating added back.

Together with B1 (operator-pool ablation) this decomposes where the quality
comes from: engine skeleton (this file) vs guided operators (B1) vs learned
selection (K1, negligible).

Test-pool measurement, same cells as K1. The `none` arm reproduces
GILS-uniform-1000 exactly (consistency check).

Usage:
    python experiments/b2_run.py
