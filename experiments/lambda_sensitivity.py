"""Phase C3: tardiness-weight (lambda) sensitivity.

Justifies the modelling choice lambda = 1 by tracing the makespan-vs-tardiness
trade-off as lambda varies. The engine minimises makespan + lambda * total
tardiness; sweeping lambda and recording the *physical* makespan and total
tardiness of the returned schedule yields a Pareto-style trade-off curve.

Methodology: run on the TUNING pool, never the test pool. Lambda is a modelling
parameter, so a curve justifying its value belongs to model design, not final
reporting. Seeds depend only on (index, rep) so the sole difference across
lambda values on a given (instance, rep) is the objective weight (paired design).

Run:
    python experiments/lambda_sensitivity.py
writes outputs/lambda_sensitivity.jsonl and prints a summary.
